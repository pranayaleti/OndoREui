description: Use whenever a backend route, controller, Zod schema, or Supabase Edge Function changes - and whenever check:drift or check:routes fails in CI. Keeps the Express dev API, the Supabase Edge production API, and all three clients (OndoREui, OndoREDashboard, OndoREMobile) speaking the same contract. Invoke with "drift", "route parity", "the edge function doesn't match", or "I added an endpoint".

# Contract Parity Keeper

Ondo runs **two backends for one API**: Express (`../OndoREBackend/src/`) for local dev and
Swagger, Supabase Edge Functions (`../OndoREBackend/supabase/functions/`) in production. Three
clients consume it. Drift between these is the repo's most common class of production bug -
it works locally and 404s or 500s in prod.

CI already gates this with `npm run check:drift` and `npm run check:routes`. Your job is to
make changes that pass those gates on the first run, and to repair drift when it appears.

## The parity contract

For every endpoint, these must match across Express and Edge:

1. **Path and method**, including param names.
2. **Auth guard** - same required role set. A stricter guard in one runtime is still drift.
3. **Request schema** - the Zod schema in `../OndoREBackend/src/schemas/` is the single source
   of truth. Edge must validate the same shape.
4. **Response shape and casing** - Ondo converts snake_case DB rows to camelCase via
   `rowsToCamel`. Both runtimes must do it, at the same boundary.
5. **Error envelope** - controllers throw `errors.*` from `src/utils/errors.ts` and let
   `errorHandlerMiddleware` format. Do not hand-roll `res.status(500)` or
   `instanceof z.ZodError`. Edge must produce the identical envelope.
6. **Assistant config** - `src/config/assistantConfig.ts` is the single source of truth for
   the system prompt and tool definitions. `check:drift` exists specifically because this
   file gets copied and diverges. Never fork it.

## Procedure

### When adding an endpoint

Invoke the project's own skill first - it encodes the golden path:

```
../OndoREBackend/.claude/skills/add-endpoint/SKILL.md
```

Then mirror into `supabase/functions/`, and only then update clients.

### When repairing drift

```bash
cd ../OndoREBackend
npm run check:drift    # assistant config: Node vs Edge
npm run check:routes   # route parity: Express vs prod Edge
```

Read the failure output literally. For each reported mismatch:

1. Decide which side is **correct** - production behaviour wins unless the change is an
   intentional new feature. State your choice and why before editing.
2. Fix the incorrect side. Do not fix the checker.
3. Re-run both checks.
4. Run the full local gate via the `preflight` skill before declaring done.

### Client propagation

After the API contract settles, update consumers. Grep for the endpoint path across clients:

```bash
grep -rn "<endpoint-path>" app lib ../OndoREDashboard/src ../OndoREMobile/src
```

Per client:
- **OndoREui** (Next.js, static export to GitHub Pages) - note it exports statically, so
  no server-side secrets and no runtime API routes. Fetch happens client-side.
- **OndoREDashboard** (Vite + React) - typed API layer in `src/`.
- **OndoREMobile** (Expo + TanStack Query) - update the query key and the persisted cache
  shape. A response shape change without a query-key bump serves stale, wrong-shaped data
  from AsyncStorage on next launch. This is easy to miss and hard to debug.

Report any client left un-updated as an explicit TODO with file paths - never silently.

## Output format

```
## Parity report

### Gates
check:drift  : PASS/FAIL
check:routes : PASS/FAIL
build        : PASS/FAIL
test:run     : PASS/FAIL

### Contract changes
| Endpoint | Method | Change | Express | Edge | ui | dashboard | mobile |

### Follow-ups
Anything intentionally deferred, with file paths.
```

## Rules

- The Zod schema and `assistantConfig.ts` are single sources of truth. Never duplicate them.
- Never weaken or delete a CI check to make it pass.
- Never claim done without running the `preflight` skill.
