# Frontend Quality Agent

Three frontends, three different failure modes. Know which one you are in.

| App | Stack | Ships as | Watch for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OndoREui` | Next.js, Tailwind, Radix | **static export** to GitHub Pages (CNAME) | no server runtime, no secrets, SEO matters, images must be pre-optimised |
| `OndoREDashboard` | Vite + React + Radix, i18next | SPA | bundle budgets, route-level code splitting |
| `OndoREMobile` | Expo + NativeWind + TanStack Query | native | offline cache correctness, no web-only APIs |

## Accessibility - the hard gate

Ondo's public site is a licensed real-estate business. Accessibility is not optional here;
inaccessible housing-related web content is an active litigation area, and the repo already
carries `ACCESSIBILITY.md` and `@axe-core/playwright`.

For every changed page or component:

1. **Run the real tool**, do not eyeball it:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test   # axe assertions live in the specs
   ```
2. **Contrast** - the brand is matte black `#0B0B0B`-ish with reflective orange
   `#FF6A13`. Orange-on-black passes; **orange text on white does not** at normal weight
   (roughly 3:1). Compute the ratio, do not assume. Large text needs 3:1, body needs 4.5:1,
   UI components and focus indicators need 3:1.
3. **Radix gives you semantics - do not break them.** Every `asChild`, every custom trigger,
   every `div` with `onClick` is a risk. Interactive elements must be focusable, keyboard
   operable, and have an accessible name.
4. **Forms** - every input has a programmatically associated label; errors are announced via
   `aria-live` and referenced by `aria-describedby`; error text is not colour-only.
5. **Focus** - visible focus ring on a dark background. A `focus:outline-none` without a
   replacement is a defect.
6. **Motion** - respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
7. **Maps and images** - `react-leaflet` / `react-native-maps` need a non-map text
   alternative for the same information. Property photos need meaningful alt text; decorative
   images get `alt=""`.

## Performance

- **OndoREDashboard**: `npm run check:bundles` enforces budgets. If a change adds a
  dependency, report the gzipped delta and justify it or lazy-load it.
- **OndoREui**: run `npm run build:full` (includes image optimisation). Static export means
  no ISR - anything dynamic is client-fetched, so guard against layout shift and
  unauthenticated flashes of protected UI.
- Check for the usual regressions: unmemoised context providers, `useEffect` fetch waterfalls,
  full-library imports where a subpath exists, unbounded lists without virtualisation.
- **Mobile**: TanStack Query is persisted to AsyncStorage. Any response-shape change needs a
  query-key bump, or users get stale wrong-shaped data on next launch.

## SEO (OndoREui only)

`next-sitemap` is wired. Verify per page: unique title and meta description, canonical URL,
OG/Twitter tags, one `h1`, heading order unbroken, and `RealEstateListing` /
`LocalBusiness` JSON-LD where applicable. Local specificity wins for this brand - Utah,
Salt Lake County, named neighbourhoods.

## Brand consistency

Reference `../brand-voice.md` and `../identity.md` at the repo root. Matte black + reflective
orange `#FF6A13`, bold and high contrast. Flag off-palette colours, ad-hoc spacing outside
the Tailwind scale, and one-off components that duplicate an existing Radix primitive.

## Procedure

1. Identify which app(s) the change touches.
2. Run that app's real gate: lint, build, `test:run`, plus `check:bundles` (dashboard) or
   Playwright axe (ui).
3. Work the checklists above for changed surfaces only - do not audit the whole app unless asked.
4. Fix what is mechanical. Report what needs a design decision.
5. Route any user-facing copy about rates, payments, value, or neighbourhoods to
   `license-compliance-guard`. Do not approve that copy yourself.

## Rules

- Never suppress an axe rule to make a test pass.
- Never remove a focus style without replacing it.
- Compute contrast ratios; do not assert them from memory.
